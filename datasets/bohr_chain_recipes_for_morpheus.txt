Morpheus asked for the recipes for the known Bohr Universe.
I've provided similar datasets to him before for Alpha.
I absolutely love doing text editing/data processing/data munging with vim & command line tools so I was happy to provide.

This CSV file has these columns:

Column                     | Description                                          | Examples
CHAINS                     | number of reaction chains necessary. mineables are 0 | 10-chain
OTOM                       | Name of the isotope                                  | Qe-52
INPUT1                     | Input isotope                                        | I-113
INPUT2                     | Input isotope (optional 2nd input)                   | 
NRG                        | Minimal Input NRG known so far                       | 7452.15
OUTPUT1                    | Output isotope                                       | Qe-52
OUTPUT2                    | Output isotope possible                              | F-61
OTOMRO                     | OTOM Reaction Output object                          | 142405
CHEMIST WALLET             | Chemist is the wallet performing experiments         | 0xf8d0c9f300d0649861963ebae0bb568533619448
initateReaction() TX HASH  | Transaction hash of the call to initateReaction()    | 0x4d60945c219613ff601bef6120123931c383c159ae3f40b7b641f15a236d09d8
analyseReactions() TX HASH | Transaction hash of the call to analyseReactions()   | 0xfed370aefa32fba9b4f72dab9ffb4b23a70e39a0ca424d276d50b6a20cb9b6f8
NOTES                      |                                                      |

Each row has the OTOMRO number, the chemist (shape eth wallet), the initiateReaction() tx hash and analyseReactions() tx hash. The input NRG was determined from that reaction, where the chemist used like 2000 NRG as input, but the analyseReactions() tx shows that only say 1427.57 was used. For that row and reaction, the Input NRG will be given as 1428 since that's all that is needed.
