Morpheus asked for the recipes for the known Bohr Universe.
I've provided similar datasets to him before for Alpha.
I absolutely love doing text editing/data processing/data munging with vim & command line tools so I was happy to provide.

This CSV file has these columns:

Column                     | Description                                          | Examples
CHAINS                     | number of reaction chains necessary. mineables are 0 | 10-chain
OTOM                       | Name of the isotope                                  | Qe-52

There are 6 txs I rewrote the input NRG to 0.0 because I know it will work due to the stability value and decay types of the isotopes in question. These noted reactions are the ones that I saw and realized they could be done with zero input energy. So beware if you try to run these 6 exact reactions I think they have additional inputs and/or outputs which I simplified to the minimal recipes.
